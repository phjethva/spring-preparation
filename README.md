## List _of_ Questions _&_ Answers _for_ Spring Developer _Interview_

> **Q. What is Spring?**

***Answer:***

- Spring is an api or framework. The Spring api or framework consists of Spring container.
- The spring container helps us use POJO (Plain Old Java Objects) in our program.
- The POJO classes are bean classes with private data members and getter and setter methods. Using these methods, we can access data members of POJO.
- The instantiation and life cycle of objects in Java application can be done automatically by configuring them in Spring container.
- Spring has a concept called Inversion of Control(IOC). This means that the object creation does not need to be done explicitly by programmer, but it can be managed by Spring container.
- Also in Spring, there is a concept called Dependency Injection (DI). This means that we can inject an object of one class into another. The object which is injected is called helper object, and by configuring objects in Spring container, we can achieve dependency relation which is also called HAS-A relation in Java.
- E.g., Object1 of class Employee. Object2 of class MNC can be injected as dependency into an object of Employee. So an Employee object can se functionalities of MNC object.
- Also, repetitive or boilerplate code is avoided. There is code re-usability. The Amount of java code is minimized.
- In Spring, we can also make use of MVC.
